# PlayerNationalities
## About
Python program that returns the number of participants for each nationality represented on a specific smash.gg tournament (and phase to be even more precise).

Players with unknown nationalities can be listed to allow manual treatment.

Any 1v1 game should be supported (Smash Ultimate, Smash Melee, Rivals of Aether, Brawlhalla, etc) but it won't work for 2v2 and other team tournaments.

## How to use
You will need to add your own smash.gg API key in the code (look at the first few lines and add it to the relevant variable).

Overall, it's a very simple program that should be pretty self-explanatory once launched.
