# PlayerNationalities
## About
Python program that returns the number of participants for each nationality represented on a specific smash.gg tournament (and phase to be even more precise).

Players with unknown nationalities can be listed to allow manual treatment.

Any 1v1 game should be supported (Ultimate, Melee, Rivals of Aether, etc) but it won't work for 2v2 and other team tournaments.

## How to use
If you're not used to Github, Python or other code-related stuff, you can download this project and use the .exe you can find in IF you're using Windows 10 64 bits. You may try with another OS but it probably won't work.

The .py file is also available if you're feeling a bit more confident and have Python 3 on your computer. Note that you will need a smash.gg API key to use it (see the first few lines to add your own key).

Overall, it's a very simple program and everything should be pretty self-explanatory once you launched it.
